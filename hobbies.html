        <h2 class="card-title">Family</h2>
         <p>I am a loving husband and a father. I have been married for almost five years, and a father for a little over two years now. Spending time with my family is important to me because that is my main support group. My wife has been very supportive in everything I do, planned to do, and dreams I want to achieve. My wife and I started to attend concerts that features her favorite K-pop (Korean pop music) bands. It has been a new and exciting expreince for me to go to these concerts. I have a two-year old daughter. She really brightens up my day, and I'm just blessed beyond words to have her in my life. My wife and I are starting to take her to different places like a dance studio to be able to interact with other kids. </p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Friends</h2>
         <p>I sometimes either hangout with my friend, who I have known for many years now, or go online and chat with many of my friends that I made along the way since I got my first pc. When I go to hangout with my friend, sometimes it's going to a restaurant to catch up on anything that happened since the last time we got together. We also play online games together as that tends to be easier as we live a few hours away from each other. When I am online with my other friends, we are either chatting away into the night, playing all sorts of different games, or even playing D&D (Dungeons and Dragons).</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Alone</h2>
         <p>When I do get time alone, I tend to lay back, listen to music, and play games. Sometimes I do like just driving around with no destination. I usally tend to be either doing something with my family or hanging out with one of my friends, so I hardly get the time alone. I don't mind having hardly any time alone as I'm perfectly happy talking and socializing with someone.</p>
